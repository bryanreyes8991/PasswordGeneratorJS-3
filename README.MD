# Week 3 Password Generator Challenge

For my third week challenge of the bootcamp I was given a template and some code to begin writing a function that will randomly generate a password upon user input. I enjoyed attempting different ways to try and get the generator to work appropriately as there are many different ways to code something. I enjoy the versatility of Javascript and how there are many correct answers but also there are many ways things can go wrong. I hope to improve my muscle memory when reading code and broadening my understanding of implemented methods and syntaxes.
